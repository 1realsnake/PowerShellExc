# C++ PowerShell Executor

This repository contains a C++ program that allows you to execute PowerShell commands or scripts from a C++ application using the Windows API.

## How it works
The program uses the Windows API function `CreateProcess` to spawn a new PowerShell process and execute a given command.

## Requirements
- A Windows environment (since this uses the Windows API)
- Visual Studio or any C++ compiler that supports Windows API
